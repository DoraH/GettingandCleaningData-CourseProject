# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository host the R script for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Below are the data for the project:

## Steps to running the R Script (run_analysis.R)
Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to set the path of the working directory to the location of the source files in your own directory.
plyr package is required for this script.

## Tidy Data
The result of the running (run_analysis.R) is that a tidyData.txt file is being created, which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Further Information
Refer to CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
